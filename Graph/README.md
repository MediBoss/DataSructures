# Graph

## Overview
A graph is a set of vertices and edges that form connections betweens the vertices

## Keywords

* Node or Vertex : A point, usually represented by a dot in a graph.
* Edge : A connection between two verices(a line connecting two nodes).
* Loop : When an edge from a node is connected to itself. 
* Degree of a vertex : The number of vertices that are connected to to a certain node.
* Adjency : When two nodes are neighbor. Or when two nodes are connected directly(without an interim node in between).
* Path : A sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge.

## Types of Graphs


### Undirected graphs
Those simply represent edges as lines between nodes. No additional information about the relationship about the nodes besides that they are connected.

### Directed graphs

In a directed graph, the edges provide orientation(shows direction with an arrow) in addition to connecting nodes.
