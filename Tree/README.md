# Trees

Trees are essentially a hierarchical type of Data Structure. In D.S such as Lists, Queues,
Stacks, etc... items are followed by each other. Whereas with Trees, there is a parent-
child(children) relationship.

## Properties

* The Node class has a left, right, and data properties
* The Tree class only has the root Node property.

## Key Terms

* Degree: the number of subtrees of a given node.
* Leaf of nodes: trees with a degree of 0. 
* Siblings: Nodes that share a common parent.
* Level: The number of connections from the root node.
* Height: The number of levels there are in a tree.
* Depth : The number of edges from the root to the longest child.
* Size : The amount of nodes in the tree


## Why use A BST

* Fast search, insertion, deletion - especially when balanced.
* Sort as you go instead of all at once.
* Fairly simple implementation for good performance.
* Only allocates memory if its needed.

## Binary Trees

Binary trees are types of trees that requires each node to have a maximum of two children.
They do not have any rule on how data is stored within the tree.


## Binary Search Tree
BST are trees that requires to have a max of two children where the sub tree on the left is
less than or equal to the current node and the sub tree on the right is greater than the
current node.
